##Comment Annotations

* Annotations should be followed by a colon and a space and then a note describing the problem

* If multiple lines are required describe the problem, subsequent lines should be indented three spaces after
the #

* In cases where the problem is so obvious that any documentation would be redundant, annotations may be left at the end of the offending
line with no note. This usage should be the exception to the rule

**Annotation Usage**

* Use TODO to note missing features or functionality that should be added at a later date.

* Use FIXME to note broken code that needs to be fixed.

* Use OPTIMIZE to note slow or inneficient code that may cause performance problems.

* Use HACK to note code smells where questionable coding practices were used and should be refactored away.

* Use REVIEW to note anything that should be looked at to confirm it is working as intended.
