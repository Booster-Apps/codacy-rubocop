##Access Modifier Indentation

Indent the **public**, **private** and **protected** methods as much as the method definitions thet apply
to. Leave one blank line above the visibility modifier and one blank line below in order to emphasize that it applies to all methods
below it.

**Example:**

```
class SomeClass
  def public_method
    #...
  end

  private

  def private_method
    #...
  end
end
```
