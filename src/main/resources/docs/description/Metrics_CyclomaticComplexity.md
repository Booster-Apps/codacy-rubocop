##Cyclomatic Complexity

Checks the Cyclomatic complexity of a method

**What is Cyclomatic Complexity?**

Cyclomatic complexity is a source code complexity measurement that is being correlated to a number of coding errors.

It is calculated by developing a Control Flow Graph of the code that measures the number os linearly-independent paths through a program module.

If you lower the Program's Cyclomatic complexity you lower the risk to modify and easier to understand.
