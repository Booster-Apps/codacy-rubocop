# Codacy Rubocop

This is the docker engine we use at Codacy to have [Rubocop](https://www.rubocop.org) support.
You can also create a docker to integrate the tool and language of your choice!
See the [codacy-engine-scala-seed](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-engine-scala-seed) repository for more information.

## Usage

You can create the docker by doing:

```
docker build -t codacy-rubocop-base .
sbt docker:publishLocal
```

The docker is ran with the following command:

```
docker run -it -v $srcDir:/src  <DOCKER_NAME>:<DOCKER_VERSION>
```

## Add plugin

Rubocop is moving some checks to separate repositories, as an example you can check
https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop/pull/6890

There are some important details to take into consideration:
- Add dependency to Gemfile
- Add it to src/main/scala/codacy/rubocop/Rubocop.scala

```diff
- private val plugins: List[String] = List("rubocop-performance")
+ private val plugins: List[String] = List("rubocop-performance", "rubocop-style")
```

- Add it to src/main/ruby/rubocop_doc/generator.rb

```diff
- $plugins = ["rubocop-performance"]
+ $plugins = ["rubocop-performance", "rubocop-style"]
```

- `bundle install` so the examples for the documentation are made available at
`vendor/bundle/ruby/{ruby_version}/gems/{plugin}/lib/rubocop/cop/*/*.rb`
- Adding the plugin to the `$plugins` will also make the script to *require* it,
to be able to fetch Cops for the base documentation

## Test

We use the [codacy-plugins-test](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-plugins-test) to test our external tools integration.
You can follow the instructions there to make sure your tool is working as expected.

## Update Version with Docs

Change the version in `.rubocop-version` and then run on this project root:

```sh
bundle update
bundle install --path vendor/bundle
./scripts/doc_generate.sh <docs_location>
```

Notes on the documentation generation:
- You need to *require* the plugin, so they are injected on the *registry* when fetching the available Cops
- After the `bundle install` the documentation generator will fetch examples from the Cops of the added plugins
